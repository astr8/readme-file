# ex-build-a-website-design-system
exercice codecademy to have a basic website design inventory
the objecif is to have a website with three section: 1 for colors, 1 for fond and 1 for headliners. it will allow me to work with html and css to find a way to display it the best possible. 
I did it on my computer before publishing, and had an exemple to refer to. While trying to recreate it, i had difficulties with the position of my elements on the page, so i used the exemple code to see what was going on and realized that my css code was not attributed to the correct box, i tried to do it on the biggest container, when it was needed on an other layer...
i learned to go on google font to find new fonds. 
ilearned the importance of division in html, combined with class, to allow differents position on the webpage.
